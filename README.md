# PKHex_ForUnity

PKHex usage in Unity Engine.

Why? Because why not.


You only need the PKHex folder inside Assets. To use it, add the define symbol #PKHEX_FOR_UNITY to your project. As the included SFB uses PKHexForUnity namespace, if you already have it in your project, you only need to delete the Plugins folder inside.
